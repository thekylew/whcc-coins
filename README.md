# WHCC Backend/API Engineer Case Study
Create a **private** [mirror copy](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/duplicating-a-repository#mirroring-a-repository) of this repo in your own Github account.

Please add your WHCC contact to that repo as a collaborator when you're done.

The purpose of this case study is for us to better understand where your technical expertise is at.

# Description
Create an application that accepts an amount of money (USD) as input, and returns a set of coins that add up to that amount.
The algorithm should optimize for the fewest number of coins.

The following coins are allowed - dollar coin, quarter, dime, nickel, and penny. Use a language of your choice, and feel free to use libraries that support the goal.

When you’re satisfied with your solution, provide a link to a repository and instructions to build and run the code. Try to timebox the work to approximately 60 minutes.

# Discussion Notes
1. What decisions did you make before you began development?
1. How did you decide what to work on in order to meet the time constraint?
1. What was your decision making process for your code organization?
1. If you had more time, what would you have implemented?
